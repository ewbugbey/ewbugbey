- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Elizabeth Bugbey! People call me Bug for short.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in real estate, personal health & wellness, and cooking.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data visualization in Python (again!). It has been a while since I learned Python at Georgia Tech and I'm in need of a refresher.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ewbugbey@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I had a 5-year career in product management but am pursuing a career pivot towards data science & engineering. This will serve as a repo for my personal portfolio of projects where I hope to demonstrate my skills.
